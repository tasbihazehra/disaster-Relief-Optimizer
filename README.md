#Disaster Relief Route Optimizer (C++)

## Project Motivation
In the wake of the 2023 earthquakes in Turkey, it became clear that the biggest challenge for rescue teams is navigating damaged infrastructure. I developed this tool to simulate how **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** can be used to find the safest and fastest routes for aid delivery when certain roads are blocked or destroyed.

##  Technical Implementation
* **Language:** C++
* **Algorithm:** Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm.
* **Data Structure:** Adjacency Lists and Priority Queues (STL).
* **Logic:** The system treats cities as 'Nodes' and roads as 'Edges'. Each road is given a weight based on its damage level (1 = Clear, 10 = Blocked).

##  AI Acknowledgement
This project was built with the assistance of **Google Gemini** for algorithmic architecture and debugging. My goal was to use AI as a technical tutor to implement concepts beyond my current college syllabus.

##  Connection to Turkey
This project is dedicated to improving disaster response logistics in earthquake prone regions like South-Eastern Turkey and Northern Pakistan.
